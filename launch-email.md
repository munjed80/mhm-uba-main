- Data lost if browser cache is cleared

**Production Mode (Supabase):**
- Data stored in secure cloud (AWS)

## 💡 Tips for Success

**1. Start Small**
Don't try to import everything on day one. Add a few clients and projects first, then expand as you get comfortable.

**2. Use the Quick Actions**
The dashboard quick action buttons (+New Client, +New Project, etc.) are the fastest way to create new items.

**3. Link Everything**
Link projects to clients, tasks to projects, invoices to clients. This creates a complete business picture.

**4. Regular Backups**
Export your data weekly (Settings → Export Data). It only takes 30 seconds and provides peace of mind.

**5. Customize for Your Business**
Upload your logo, customize invoice templates, add custom fields. Make UBA truly yours.

**6. Explore All Features**
Set aside time to click through every page and feature. You might discover capabilities you didn't know you needed!
